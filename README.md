# My Todo List App


## About

Welcome to my Todo List App! This project is inspired by Web Dev Simplified, and it's a simple yet effective task management tool that I've customized to fit my needs and preferences.

**Credit:**

I'd like to give credit to the [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified) YouTube channel for providing the inspiration for this project. Their insightful tutorials on web development have been a valuable resource in my learning journey. If you're interested in web development, I highly recommend checking out their content.

## My Contributions

While the core idea for this Todo List App comes from Web Dev Simplified, I've put in substantial effort to make it my own by:

- [List any specific features or customizations you've added]
- [Explain how you've tailored the project to your needs]
- [Mention any additional work you've done]


I'd like to thank Web Dev Simplified for their inspiration and guidance throughout this project.
